Plants $A$, $B$ and $C$ make $80$, $140$ and $130$ units per month, respectively. Retail outlets $K$, $L$, $M$ and $N$ need to receive $80$, $30$, $90$ and $120$ units per month, respectively. Suppose that each unit maintained at plants $A$, $B$ and $C$ has a penalty cost (in monetary units) of $0.5$, $1$ and $1$, respectively. Use the transportation simplex method to determine the best plan for how many units to send from each plant to the retail outlets each month, minimizing the total shipping cost. Use the minimum cost rule to obtain an initial basic feasible solution.
