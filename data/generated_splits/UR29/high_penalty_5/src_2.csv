Plants $1$, $2$, and $3$ produce $12$, $17$, and $11$ shipments per month, respectively. Each distribution center needs to receive $10$ shipments per month. The distance (in miles) from each plant ($i$) to the respective distributing centers ($j$) is given below:

\[

The freight cost for each shipment is $100.50?$ per mile. Use the transportation simplex method to determine how much should be shipped from each plant to each of the distribution centers each month, to minimize the total shipping cost. Use the minimum cost rule to obtain an initial basic feasible solution.
